INSERT INTO Artists (Name, Bio, CreatedDate, ModifiedDate) VALUES('Daft Punk', 'Daft Punk were a French electronic music duo formed in 1993 in Paris by Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter. Widely regarded as one of the most influential acts in dance music history, they achieved popularity in the late 1990s as part of the French house movement. They garnered critical acclaim and commercial success in the years following, combining elements of house music with funk, techno, disco, indie rock and pop.

After Bangalter and Homem-Christo''s indie rock band Darlin'' disbanded, they began experimenting with drum machines, synthesisers and the talk box. Their debut studio album Homework was released by Virgin Records in 1997 to positive reviews, backed by singles "Around the World" and "Da Funk". From 1999, they assumed robot personas with helmets, outfits and gloves for public appearances to preserve their identities; they made few media appearances. They were managed from 1996 to 2008 by Pedro Winter, the head of Ed Banger Records.

Daft Punk''s second album, Discovery (2001), had further success, supported by hit singles "One More Time", "Digital Love" and "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger". The album became the basis for an animated film, Interstella 5555, supervised by a Japanese animator Leiji Matsumoto. Daft Punk''s third album, Human After All (2005), received mixed reviews, though the singles "Robot Rock" and "Technologic" achieved success in the United Kingdom. The duo directed their first film, Electroma, an avant-garde science fiction film, in 2006. They toured throughout 2006 and 2007 and released the live album Alive 2007, which won a Grammy Award for Best Electronic/Dance Album; the tour is credited for popularising dance music in North America. Daft Punk composed the score for the 2010 film Tron: Legacy.

In 2013, Daft Punk left Virgin for Columbia Records and released their fourth album, Random Access Memories, to acclaim; lead single "Get Lucky" reached the top 10 in the charts of 32 countries. Random Access Memories won five Grammy Awards in 2014, including Album of the Year and Record of the Year for "Get Lucky". In 2016, Daft Punk gained their only number one on the Billboard Hot 100 with "Starboy", a collaboration with the Weeknd. Rolling Stone ranked them the 12th greatest musical duo.

INSERT INTO Artists (Name, Bio, CreatedDate, ModifiedDate) VALUES('Elvis Presley', 'Elvis Aaron Presley (January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977) was an American singer and actor. Dubbed the "King of Rock and Roll", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, led him to both great success and initial controversy.

Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee, with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience. Presley, on rhythm acoustic guitar, and accompanied by lead guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley''s classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage him for more than two decades. Presley''s first RCA Victor single, "Heartbreak Hotel", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. Within a year, RCA would sell ten million Presley singles. With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records, Presley became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll.

In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in Love Me Tender. Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He held few concerts, however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special Elvis, which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, Aloha from Hawaii. Years of prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health, and he died suddenly in 1977 at his Graceland estate at the age of 42.

With his rise from poverty to significant fame, Presley''s success seemed to epitomize the American Dream. Recognized as the best-selling solo music artist of all time by Guinness World Records, Presley was commercially successful in many genres, including pop, country, R&B, adult contemporary, and gospel. He won three Grammy Awards, received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36, and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame. Presley holds several records; the most RIAA certified gold and platinum albums, the most albums charted on the Billboard 200, and the most number-one albums by a solo artist on the UK Albums Chart and the most number-one singles by any act on the UK Singles Chart. In 2018, Presley was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Donald Trump.', DATE('now'), DATE('now'));

INSERT INTO Artists (Name, Bio, CreatedDate, ModifiedDate) VALUES('Cyndi Lauper', 'Cynthia Ann Stephanie Lauper (born June 22, 1953) is an American singer, songwriter, actress and activist. Her career has spanned over 40 years. Her album She''s So Unusual (1983) was the first debut album by a female artist to achieve four top-five hits on the Billboard Hot 100—"Girls Just Want to Have Fun", "Time After Time", "She Bop", and "All Through the Night"—and earned Lauper the Best New Artist award at the 27th Grammy Awards in 1985. Her success continued with the soundtrack for the motion picture The Goonies and her second record True Colors (1986). This album included the number one single "True Colors" and "Change of Heart", which peaked at number three. In 1989, she had a hit with "I Drove All Night".

Since 1983, Lauper has released eleven studio albums and participated in many other projects. In 2010, Memphis Blues became Billboard''s most successful blues album of the year, remaining at number one on the Billboard Blues Albums chart for 13 consecutive weeks. In 2013, Lauper won the Tony Award for best original score for composing the Broadway musical Kinky Boots, making her the first woman to win the category by herself. The musical was awarded five other Tonys including Tony Award for Best New Musical. In 2014, Lauper was awarded the Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album for the cast recording. In 2016, the West End production won Best New Musical at the Olivier Awards.

INSERT INTO Artists (Name, Bio, CreatedDate, ModifiedDate) VALUES('Duran Duran', 'Duran Duran (/djʊˌræn djʊˈræn/) are an English new wave band formed in Birmingham in 1978. The group was a leading band in the MTV-driven Second British Invasion of the US in the 1980s. The group was formed by keyboardist Nick Rhodes and bassist John Taylor, with the later addition of drummer Roger Taylor, and after numerous personnel changes, guitarist Andy Taylor (none of the Taylors are related) and lead singer Simon Le Bon. These five members featured the most commercially successful line-up.

When Duran Duran emerged they were generally considered part of the New Romantic scene, along with bands such as Spandau Ballet and Visage. The video age catapulted Duran Duran into the mainstream with the introduction of the 24-hour music channel MTV. Many of their videos were shot on 35 mm film, which gave a much more polished look than was standard at the time. They also collaborated with professional film directors to take the quality a step further, often teaming up with Australian director Russell Mulcahy for some of their most memorable video offerings. In 1984, the band was an early innovator with video technology in its live stadium shows. The band was one of the most successful acts of the 1980s, though by the end of the decade, membership and music style changes challenged the band before a resurgence in the early 1990s.

The group has never disbanded, but after the departures of Andy and Roger Taylor in 1986, the line-up changed to include two American musicians: former Missing Persons guitarist Warren Cuccurullo from 1989 to 2001 and drummer Sterling Campbell from 1989 to 1991. The reunion of the original five members in the early 2000s created a stir among the band''s fans and music media. Andy Taylor left the band once again in mid-2006, and guitarist Dominic Brown has since been working with the band as a session player and touring member.

Duran Duran has sold over 100 million records, making them one of the world''s best-selling music artists. They achieved 30 top 40 singles in the U.K. 14 singles in the top 10 of the UK Singles Chart and 21 in the US Billboard Hot 100. The band have won numerous awards throughout their career: two Brit Awards including the 2004 award for Outstanding Contribution to Music, two Grammy Awards, an MTV Video Music Award for Lifetime Achievement, and a Video Visionary Award from the MTV Europe Music Awards.

This piece finally opened my eyes to the reality of this world, and that reality is that everything is a piano. A chair is not a chair, it''s just a piano with the legs closer together and no keys, with a very low build. Mr. Green is not a person, he is just a piano that''s just missing two legs and is able to speak. Everything is a piano! I never noticed it until listening to the tinkling tonal pleasures that emanated from my computer during this listening blog. I could feel the uplifting harmony with all five senses. It smelt like the angels of heaven, it looked like a strip of bacon, it sounded like the angelic entities from above, and it tasted like three strips of bacon. Then, when the cadence built up and overflowed into the timbre of the anacrusis, it was absolutely electrifying! I literally felt surges of electricity flowing through me. My parents thought it was because I had accidentally stuck my car keys in the wall outlet, but I know better. I know that this piece affected me like none has ever before! Absolutely electrifying! The way the diatonic super-harmony was buried beneath a timbre-less multi-cadence of post-productional half steps which were proportionally matched with enharmonic hemiolas extracted from a major median reduction was absolutely brilliant! I loved how the composer reversed the staggered timbre and smelted the rhythm into a structural phenomenon of conjugated fourths with an augmented anacrusis in the bass. But the best idea of all was when the composer eludicated the octatonic quadruplet while simultaneously reintegrating the augmented second inversion tuba into a plagal pleasure. I''d say the main thing was probably like a bebop-soul fusion with a ragtime refrain. The Cantus Firmus definitely can be traced back to influences of popular modern plainsong, while the species reduction is definitely based on a soft, plagal rock. The intonation of the Rhythmus Firmus and the Melodic Canticle caught my ear even before the anacrusis had ended, and the retardation of the Cantus Ants-In-My-Pantsus was clocked at a record tempo! Every element of theory was present in this piece from the beginning to the end! There were whole notes, and definitely half notes as well. The variety even went deeper.

The way it flows is pretty much unparalleled, and I have great admiration for the skill required by the composer to offer such wonders to his loyal fans. I wrote the notes of this piece out as I was listening to it, for the sole reason of later being able to go back through and circle every non-harmonic tone. It was a fun time! Normally, all the minor cadences in this piece would trap the listener in a repetitive musical mind bubble, but the way the composer cleverly uses textural reduction and autotonsorialistic slubberdegullion in such a unique way frees up the listener to experience a new level of fluent cadence. I really like the deceptive cadence at the very end that goes from 5 to minor sixth, then climbs back up to the high 1 chord to finish it off. I feel like this also matched the main motive progression, so it didn''t sound out of place. I have to give the performer an A+ for a great performance. Even though there was a slip on the 342nd note, and the 56th cadence did not conform to the expected dynamic, those were the only two mistakes.

It has unduly left a black mark upon society, and the only hope for mankind is to completely obliterate every trace of this horrendous abomination, and kill those who have heard it so it cannot possibly be replicated for as long into the foreseeable future as possible. Firstly, let''s distinguish two different things. There are pieces that, musically, think outside the box, and create new and memorable experiences for the listener. Then there are pieces that are so far out of the box that, in essence, they just become idiotic and absurd. A burden to listen to. This piece is of the latter category, and even that might be complimenting it to much. Let''s start off to say that the moldy, stinking melody doesn''t even flow. And that wouldn''t usually be a problem, but nothing flows!! Not the stale harmony, the moisture-infested rhythm, or the fungus-covered Cantus Firmus. If this piece were a disease, it would be a strain of leprosy that somehow bonded with ebola. And there I go giving it too much credit for what it''s actually worth again. It sounds as if a whole slew of songwriters were brought into their little cubicle farm to crank out a song to spoonfeed to the masses, like most music is written nowadays, and they just synced up their musescores and started going note happy like there was no tomorrow, without any regard to what any of their peers were writing.

This piece finally opened my eyes to the reality of this world, and that reality is that everything is a piano. A chair is not a chair, it''s just a piano with the legs closer together and no keys, with a very low build. Mr. Green is not a person, he is just a piano that''s just missing two legs and is able to speak. Everything is a piano! I never noticed it until listening to the tinkling tonal pleasures that emanated from my computer during this listening blog. I could feel the uplifting harmony with all five senses. It smelt like the angels of heaven, it looked like a strip of bacon, it sounded like the angelic entities from above, and it tasted like three strips of bacon. Then, when the cadence built up and overflowed into the timbre of the anacrusis, it was absolutely electrifying! I literally felt surges of electricity flowing through me. My parents thought it was because I had accidentally stuck my car keys in the wall outlet, but I know better. I know that this piece affected me like none has ever before! Absolutely electrifying! The way the diatonic super-harmony was buried beneath a timbre-less multi-cadence of post-productional half steps which were proportionally matched with enharmonic hemiolas extracted from a major median reduction was absolutely brilliant! I loved how the composer reversed the staggered timbre and smelted the rhythm into a structural phenomenon of conjugated fourths with an augmented anacrusis in the bass. But the best idea of all was when the composer eludicated the octatonic quadruplet while simultaneously reintegrating the augmented second inversion tuba into a plagal pleasure. I''d say the main thing was probably like a bebop-soul fusion with a ragtime refrain. The Cantus Firmus definitely can be traced back to influences of popular modern plainsong, while the species reduction is definitely based on a soft, plagal rock. The intonation of the Rhythmus Firmus and the Melodic Canticle caught my ear even before the anacrusis had ended, and the retardation of the Cantus Ants-In-My-Pantsus was clocked at a record tempo! Every element of theory was present in this piece from the beginning to the end! There were whole notes, and definitely half notes as well. The variety even went deeper. If you don''t listen to this, you are probably a loser, because this song is worth the full listen, even if it is 92 minutes long. Would I recommend to a friend?

The way the diatonic super-harmony was buried beneath a timbre-less multi-cadence of post-productional half steps which were proportionally matched with enharmonic hemiolas extracted from a major median reduction was absolutely brilliant! I loved how the composer reversed the staggered timbre and smelted the rhythm into a structural phenomenon of conjugated fourths with an augmented anacrusis in the bass. But the best idea of all was when the composer eludicated the octatonic quadruplet while simultaneously reintegrating the augmented second inversion tuba into a plagal pleasure. I''d say the main thing was probably like a bebop-soul fusion with a ragtime refrain. The Cantus Firmus definitely can be traced back to influences of popular modern plainsong, while the species reduction is definitely based on a soft, plagal rock. The intonation of the Rhythmus Firmus and the Melodic Canticle caught my ear even before the anacrusis had ended, and the retardation of the Cantus Ants-In-My-Pantsus was clocked at a record tempo!

It has unduly left a black mark upon society, and the only hope for mankind is to completely obliterate every trace of this horrendous abomination, and kill those who have heard it so it cannot possibly be replicated for as long into the foreseeable future as possible. Firstly, let''s distinguish two different things. There are pieces that, musically, think outside the box, and create new and memorable experiences for the listener. Then there are pieces that are so far out of the box that, in essence, they just become idiotic and absurd. A burden to listen to. This piece is of the latter category, and even that might be complimenting it to much. Let''s start off to say that the moldy, stinking melody doesn''t even flow. And that wouldn''t usually be a problem, but nothing flows!! Not the stale harmony, the moisture-infested rhythm, or the fungus-covered Cantus Firmus. If this piece were a disease, it would be a strain of leprosy that somehow bonded with ebola. And there I go giving it too much credit for what it''s actually worth again. It sounds as if a whole slew of songwriters were brought into their little cubicle farm to crank out a song to spoonfeed to the masses, like most music is written nowadays, and they just synced up their musescores and started going note happy like there was no tomorrow, without any regard to what any of their peers were writing. If you took some bad pieces, and sort-of mashed them all into one, that would be this piece. A failure. Failure.
