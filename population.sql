But Asia''s third largest economy isn''t out of the woods yet and remains smaller than at the start of the pandemic.

GDP rose 20.1% in the three months to June 30, compared with the same period a year earlier. The big jump reflects a rebound from the deep slump in activity in 2020, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi imposed one of the world''s toughest lockdowns on 1.3 billion people, restricting business and travel for months and plunging the country into its first recession in decades.', '2021-08-31', 'TechnicalRadiationAdmin', DATE('now'), DATE('now'));

That will depend partly on whether drivers get so fed up with the speed limit that they choose to commute in other ways.', '2021-08-31', 'TechnicalRadiationAdmin', DATE('now'), DATE('now'));

Starting this week, minors will be allowed only an hour of play time between 8 pm and 9 pm on Friday, weekends and public holidays, according to a statement from Chinese media watchdog — the National Press and Publication Administration (NPPA) — that was posted by state news agency Xinhua on Monday.
The move represents a huge tightening of earlier limits set by the agency in 2019, which had restricted play to 90 minutes on weekdays and three hours on weekends for children. Authorities said that the restrictions were put in place to help prevent young people becoming addicted to video games.
The NPPA noted this week that the rules were being issued "at the beginning of the new [school] semester, putting specific requirements for preventing the addiction to online games, and protecting the healthy growth of minors."
Investors were quick to react. NetEase (NTES) slumped 3.4% during regular trading hours in New York on Monday. Tencent (TCEHY) suffered roughly the same drop in Hong Kong on Tuesday before ticking back up 1.6%.', '2021-08-31', 'TechnicalRadiationAdmin', DATE('now'), DATE('now'));
